MVC6 Redis Session And Cache

This web app is using dnx451 framework and the rc1 versions of the framework.

Once the solution is opened, the redis settings are located under the web app, appsettings.json.

Due to an issue with the interface that the RedisCache class implements, I had to implement my own class in order to use Redis for session.
